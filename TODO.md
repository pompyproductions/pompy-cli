# To-do list

## Next patch (0.2.1)

None! Just focus on development one minor update at a time.

## Next minor update (0.3.0)

- Make `CLIContext.input()` or `util.input()` prompt "Press any key to continue". 
- Make hidden and default options available for all prompts (`help`, `quit`)
- Place demos in a separate folder (outside src), so that people can see how it's imported and used.
- Have a main file that prints the version and says "for examples, (...)"


## Future minor update (0.#.0)

- Interactive demos that can be run with main (with args).

## Next major update (1.0.0)

There's no grand plan yet, the project is still in development phase!
